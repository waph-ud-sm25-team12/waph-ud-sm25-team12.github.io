Sprint Retrospection:

  What went well:

    The team worked well together and balanced the technical/non-technical division of work.

    The team managed to complete tasks by the deadline and implement the main aspects of the projects (login, registration, edit profile, etc.)

    The secure database access and PHP integration was fairly smooth.

    Neeraj helped facilitate the testing and contributed screenshots for documentation which was beneficial in validating the completed sprint work.

    The change password functionality was developed collaboratively and pass the tests as defined by manual testing.

  Challenges faced:

    Some lost time early in the sprint with file organization not being clear and inconsistent form naming conventions.

    The change password logic required testing in a back-and-forth fashion because of session management concerns.

    There was some coordination involved with the technical and non-technical work streams being separate, we needed to have more sync meetings.

    There were variable commmit frequency (some members were pushing commits more often) which made it slightly harder to assess shared progress in real-time.

  Ideas for improvements for the next sprint:

    Schedule a short team-sync during the sprint to provide visibility and communication.

    Implement using standard file naming conventions and file-PHP routing as early as possible in the sprint.

    Encouraging all members to push more frequent commits would help in portions of code reviews and help to minimize merge issues.

    It would also be beneficial to start the UI layout design drafts early and break into smaller deliverables to distribute workload.
